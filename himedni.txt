Hej medni. Jag gjorde bara lite. (Att skapa service och .py file inne.) 
It's a very small thing I think, but it took so long time for me. I hope it helps anyway.
I used path/command lie this. 


sudo vi usr/sbin/cpu_usage.py 

- You can see what is written in python3 file.  


sudo vi etc/systemd/system/cpu_usage.service 

- You can see what is written in service file.


sudo systemctl start cpu_usage.service 

- You can start the service file 
- You can also stop,start,restart,enable.. etc.
sometimes I used enable and restart when it says that it's not working because of "bad setting"


cat /tmp/sayhello.txt 
- You can see what is written directly on the prompt. 


I'm not sure how we could get the message text when the user used specific amount of memories.
Should we use cron? because Patrik mentioned it directly after the systemd class? 
not sure, I'll work on more on Thursday and I hope we could finish it on Thursday
because I don't have time on Friday either, unfortunately. :(
