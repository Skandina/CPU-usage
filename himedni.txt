Hej medni. Jag gjorde bara lite. (Att skapa service och .py file inne.) 
It's a very small thing I think, but it took so long time for me. I hope it helps anyway.
I used path/command lie this. 


sudo vi usr/sbin/cpu_usage.py 

- You can see what is written in python3 file.  


sudo vi etc/systemd/system/cpu_usage.service 

- You can see what is written in service file.


sudo systemctl start cpu_usage.service 

- You can start the service file 
- You can also stop,start,restart,enable.. etc.
sometimes I used enable and restart when it says that it's not working because of "bad setting"


cat /tmp/sayhello.txt 
- You can see what is written directly on the prompt.
